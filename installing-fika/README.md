# Installing Fika

## Before installing Fika

**Always** keep in mind that Fika is an unofficial [SPT](https://sp-tarkov.com/#download) mod. You **must** have a working SPT installation before attempting to install Fika. There is absolutely no point in trying to install Fika before you ensure that SPT is working first.

This means that you must be able to start a game in SPT without any issues, and you should not be running any mods before installing Fika. Please ensure this is the case before continuing with the next steps.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are unsure how to install SPT, please follow their instructions [here](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/672-spt-installer/) and come back here once they are completed. Again, make sure that your SPT installation works before continuing.
{% endhint %}

We recommend reading the [General information](../General-information.md) section so you have a better understanding of how Fika works.

## Prerequisites

* You must have an up-to-date and working installation of SPT **with no mods installed**.
* Bleeding edge versions of SPT are _**NOT**_ supported by Fika.
* Identify your SPT installation folder. This will be referred to as `SPT folder`.

## Hardware Requirements

These are recommendations for a smooth experience:

* **CPU**: i7 8700k / Ryzen 5 3600X
* **GPU**: GTX 2070 / RX 5700 XT
* **Memory**: 32 GB RAM
* **Storage**: SSD is mandatory, no support is given for installations on a HDD

These are recommendations for a dedicated client:

* **CPU**: >4 GHz per core
* **Memory**: 32 GB RAM
* **Storage**: SSD is mandatory

The biggest gain in Fika (and in SPT in general) will be getting a stronger CPU and RAM.

{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Start `SPT.Server.exe`

You should see: `Mod: server version: <Fika version> by: Fika loaded` in the console window. If you don't see it, you did not extract Fika-Server in the correct location.

You should get a Fika disclaimer upon entering the menu. Read the disclaimer and wait until the timer runs out.
